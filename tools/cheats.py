"""Cheat files to code patch sets: the code cheats of the mods' Atmosphere cheat files become patch sets of the lifted
game.

Lifted code cannot be written to while the game runs, so a cheat that writes instructions into main's .text is turned
into `site` lines (recomp/patches.py) when the game is lifted; the runtime (runtime/cheats.c) switches each cheat's set
from the in-game menu. A cheat that only writes data (heap, main's data, pointer chains, button conditions) needs no
patch: runtime/cheats.c runs it in its cheat VM.

  python tools/cheats.py --exefs <dir> --mods <mods folder> [--builtin <folder>] --patches <patch file>
                         --out <patch file> --status <file>

--builtin is the folder of the port's own cheat lists (tools/data/cheats, which runtime/cheats.c embeds): its
<build id>.txt goes first, as the mod "Built-in" (CHEATS_BUILTIN in runtime/cheats.h). The cheat files are <mod>/cheats/<build id>.txt in each folder of --mods (or the Atmosphere places of that folder,
as runtime/cheats.c finds them; the name's case does not matter), the build id the first 8 bytes of main's. Every mod's
file is built, switched on or off: the runtime decides which run. --out gets the --patches file followed by one set
per convertible cheat (`cheat_<hash>`, switch XCX_CHEAT_<HASH>, default off) and its sites. --status gets one line
per cheat, mods by name, cheats in file order, tab separated:

  <name hash> <content hash> <kind> <buttons> <note>

name hash: FNV-1a 32 of "<mod folder name>/<cheat name>" in UTF-8 (a name repeated in one file: name + "#2", "#3" ...),
8 upper-case hex digits, so two mods' cheats of one name are apart; content
hash: the same over the cheat's words, so the runtime sees an edited cheat that was not rebuilt. kind:
  code       instruction writes, a patch set
  key        instruction writes while buttons are held (8 mask / writes / 21 else / the original words / 20): a patch
             set the runtime switches on while the cheat is on and <buttons> (hex HidNpadButton mask) are held
  master     a {master} cheat with instruction writes: a set that is always on
  restore    writes only the original instructions (switching a cheat off restores them): nothing to do
  cave       writes only past main's image, a code cave other cheats branch into: its words go into theirs
  heading    no opcodes (a title or a group label)
  data       no instruction writes: the runtime's cheat VM
  unsupported <note> says why
A code cheat that calls or jumps into a code cave it writes (words where main has zeros) gets the cave's body inlined
at the call site; a conditional skip of one store in the body (cbz wN, +8; str wN, ...) is dropped. Branches inside
the cave stay branches inside the inlined body (`<word>@<index>` words, recomp/patches.py), and a b or bl out of the
cave as its last word is encoded again for the site.

Standard library and recomp/ only.
