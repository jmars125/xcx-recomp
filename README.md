# XCX Recomp

**XCX Recomp** is a static recompilation of *Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition* (Nintendo Switch, 2025) into a native Windows x86-64 application ([docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)). It is a fork of [TotK Recomp](https://github.com/valentderah/totk-pc-recomp) by Valiantsin Dzerakh.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No game files are included.** You need your own legally obtained copy of *Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition*, dumped from your own console: the base game and the 2.0.0 update (the add-on content is optional). Instructions for obtaining those files will not be provided.
>
> The game is built from your files on your machine, so the result contains the game. It is for your own use. Do not share it.

## Status

Early development. New Game, cutscenes and gameplay run on Windows with sound, text and the menu, at 60 fps by
default (30 to 360 in the settings; above 60 is experimental).

Report problems as issues, following [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Features

- Native code, not emulation
- Update 2.0.0 and the Exploration Support Package add-on content
- XCX-Setup: builds the game from your own NSP files and `prod.keys`
- In-game settings menu (F1) and performance overlay (F10)
- Keyboard, mouse and gamepad

## Planned

- Linux and the Steam Deck
- Mods made for emulators: unpack a mod into a `mods` folder
- Custom aspect ratios, including ultrawide
- VRR

## Installing

Requirements: Windows 10 or later, an x86-64 CPU with AVX2, a GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and `VK_EXT_external_memory_host`, about 36 GiB free during setup (20 GiB after).

1. Download `XCX-Setup-<version>-windows.zip` from [Releases](../../releases/latest) and unpack it.
2. Start `XCX-Setup.exe`. If SmartScreen warns about an unsigned app, choose *More info*, then *Run anyway*.
3. Pick your game files, the language and an install folder, and press *Start*. The setup builds the game once.
4. Play `xcx.exe` from the install folder.

To update, run a newer `XCX-Setup.exe` on the same folder; saves and settings are kept. Settings are in the in-game menu and in `xcx.ini` ([xcx.ini.example](xcx.ini.example) lists every key). Controls: [docs/controls.md](docs/controls.md).

## License

The project's own code is under the [MIT License](LICENSE); third-party code keeps its own license ([THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)). The license grants nothing for Nintendo's game.

## Building from source

[docs/building.md](docs/building.md) lists the toolchain and the steps. Everything the build writes stays under `build\` and `generated\`, which git ignores; run `tools/check_content.py` before a commit. Testers: [docs/tester-guide.md](docs/tester-guide.md).

Most of the code and documentation is written by AI coding agents (Claude Code) under the maintainer's direction; the maintainer plays every build and decides what is merged. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the rules they work under.
