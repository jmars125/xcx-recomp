// Verified facts about the shared inline-icon source (XCX DE 2.0.0 main). Geometry and identity only: no game pixels.
//
// Source and tag mapping (offline message tables and msbp enum, runtime capture of six tags, closed-form grid):
//   * `[ST:icon p1=<tag> ]` becomes `[ML:icon ...]`; f_7000a21afc looks the code up in a 48-record table at `source+0x38`.
//   * The code is the record index; the msbp icon enum order gives code = position: ... pls 4, x 5, y 6, a 7, b 8, ...
//     l 13, r 14, zl 15, zr 16, ..., and the same 24 again as the large variants (+24: x_l 29, a_l 31, l_l 37, ...).
//   * The records are a closed form over an 8x6 grid of 46x50 cells in a 368x300 BC7 texture, NVN format 77:
//     {1, 1, 45/368, 149/900, (col*46+0.5)/368, (row*50+0.5)/300, u16 46, u16 50}; INLINE_RECORDS_SHA256 is that table.
//   * The draw's second pass binds entry 0 of the source's texture set; its first qwords are 0x012c0170'0000004d (height
//     300, width 368, format 0x4d) and the texture storage address at qword 4.
// The atlas and the icon_button sheet draw the same 24 symbols in the same order (the msbp tag order from `crs`); a record or
// cell index modulo 24 is the symbol (input_glyphs.h SYM_*). Only the replaceable symbols' cells are ever replaced; power, home and
// capture, and every cell not listed here, keep their native pixels.
